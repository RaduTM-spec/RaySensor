# RaySensor tool
RaySensor is a special component used to cast multiple rays in any direction wanted by oadding it to the agent gameObject. Working both in 3D and 2D(on XY and ZY planes), it provides a simple to adjust interface in order to produce the agent relative distances to the environment objects inside a public float[] variable called **observations**.
