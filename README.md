# RaySensor tool
RaySensor is a special component used to cast multiple rays in any direction wanted by adding it to the agent gameObject. Working both in 3D and 2D, it provides a simple to adjust interface in order to produce the agent relative distances to the environment objects inside a public float[] variable called **observations**. 
RayDetectable is a component that must be added to GameObjects when the rays need to get value info about the hit object.
